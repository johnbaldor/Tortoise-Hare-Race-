In main:  


Initialize variables 


Prompt user for value 
Get value from terminal and store in variable 
Use variable to select random seed 


If all of the animals positions are less than 70 than run the loop:
        If Tortoise is in the lead and current winner isn't tortoise:
                Make tortoise winner and print “At t = (current time), the tortoise (square (current tortoise
position)) has taken the lead.”


If Hare is in the lead and current winner isn't hare:
                Make hare winner and print “At t = (current time), the hare (square (current hare
position)) has taken the lead.”


If bee is in the lead and current winner isn't bee:
                Make bee winner and print “At t = (current time), the bee (square (current tortoise
position)) has taken the lead.”




current_hare _pos = update_hare(current_hare _pos)
current_tortoise_pos = update_tortoise(current_tortoise_pos)
current_bee_pos = update_bee(current_bee_pos)
Update time by adding 1 




If winner is hare:
        Print “After (ending time) seconds, the hare wins!!”


If winner is tortoise:
