Going off this seed value, random movements will be selected for a bee, tortoise, and hare to see who will move 70 spaces forward first in a race. The program will print to the user when one of the animals takes the lead and when there is a winner.

gcc race.c animals.c -o theRace


To run the program, run the command:
./theRace
